• Built ETL/ ELT pipeline infrastructure using Airflow, Python, and SQL to extract and analyze Azure DevOps work item data via REST APIs, applying keyword analysis on structured and unstructured data with NLTK for bug classification, and visualizing insights in Power BI for proactive triage and root cause detection.
• Automated telemetry data ingestion and transformation by building scalable ETL pipelines using Azure Data Factory, storing outputs in Azure Data Lake for downstream analytics, reducing manual processing by 95% and enabling real-time Power BI reporting for operational decision-making.
• Leveraged cloud-based data lake infrastructure to support executive dashboards highlighting customer acquisition, operational efficiency, and overall business performance.
• Delivered a Snowflake-based data warehouse solution by orchestrating ingestion and transformation workflows with AWS Glue and Lambda, supporting scalable analytics from relational data sources.
• Improved financial reporting accuracy by eliminating 90% of manual entry errors through Python-driven EDA, outlier detection, and statistical validation supported by Matplotlib visualizations.
• Created a centralized data mart by integrating multiple data sources into a governed warehouse with clearly defined fact and dimension models, accelerating reporting cycles and improving metric consistency.
• Executed A/B and multivariate experiments on chemical process parameters to identify optimal configurations, increasing yield and reducing waste by 10%.
• Developed a Random Forest–based predictive maintenance model using historical sensor and process data, enabling proactive planning and reducing unplanned equipment downtime by ~15%.• Built ETL/ ELT pipeline infrastructure using Airflow, Python, and SQL to extract and analyze Azure DevOps work item data via REST APIs, applying keyword analysis on structured and unstructured data with NLTK for bug classification, and visualizing insights in Power BI for proactive triage and root cause detection. • Automated telemetry data ingestion and transformation by building scalable ETL pipelines using Azure Data Factory, storing outputs in Azure Data Lake for downstream analytics, reducing manual processing by 95% and enabling real-time Power BI reporting for operational decision-making. • Leveraged cloud-based data lake infrastructure to support executive dashboards highlighting customer acquisition, operational efficiency, and overall business performance. • Delivered a Snowflake-based data warehouse solution by orchestrating ingestion and transformation workflows with AWS Glue and Lambda, supporting scalable analytics from relational data sources. • Improved financial reporting accuracy by eliminating 90% of manual entry errors through Python-driven EDA, outlier detection, and statistical validation supported by Matplotlib visualizations. • Created a centralized data mart by integrating multiple data sources into a governed warehouse with clearly defined fact and dimension models, accelerating reporting cycles and improving metric consistency. • Executed A/B and multivariate experiments on chemical process parameters to identify optimal configurations, increasing yield and reducing waste by 10%. • Developed a Random Forest–based predictive maintenance model using historical sensor and process data, enabling proactive planning and reducing unplanned equipment downtime by ~15%.…see more
